# Next Commerce Theme Development

## Using This Skill

This skill works with any AI coding tool that can load a markdown file as context.

| Tool | How to Use |
|------|-----------|
| **Claude Code** | Install to `~/.claude/skills/next-theme-dev/` (see repo README). Invoke with `/next-theme-dev` or let Claude auto-detect from your project files. |
| **OpenAI Codex** | Pass as a system prompt: `codex --system-prompt next-theme-dev/SKILL.md` |
| **Cursor** | Add to `.cursor/rules/` or reference in your project's AI context files. |
| **GitHub Copilot** | Add to `.github/copilot-instructions.md` or include via `@workspace` reference. |
| **Other agents** | Load `SKILL.md` as context/system prompt. The instructions are tool-agnostic markdown. |

## Preamble — Environment Check

Run these checks at the start of every theme task to understand the working context:

```bash
# Check ntk installation
which ntk 2>/dev/null && ntk --version || echo "ntk not installed — install via: pip install next-theme-kit"

# Check Python
python3 --version 2>/dev/null || python --version 2>/dev/null || echo "Python not found"

# Check for theme config
[ -f config.yml ] && echo "config.yml found" || echo "No config.yml — run 'ntk init' or create one"

# Identify theme
[ -f manifest.json ] && cat manifest.json || echo "No manifest.json"
```

If `config.yml` is missing, the developer needs to create one:
```yaml
development:
  apikey: <api_key>
  store: <store_subdomain>.29next.store
  theme_id: <theme_id>
```

Get the API key from Dashboard > Settings > API Keys. Get the theme_id from `ntk list`.

## Architecture

### Directory Structure

Every Next Commerce theme follows this structure:

```
theme/
├── assets/          # CSS, JS, images, fonts (served via CDN)
├── checkout/        # Optional/legacy checkout overrides if the theme uses them
├── configs/
│   ├── settings_schema.json   # Theme editor field definitions
│   └── settings_data.json     # Stored setting values
├── layouts/
│   └── base.html    # Main layout (all pages extend this)
├── locales/         # Translation JSON files (en.json, fr.json, etc.)
├── partials/        # Reusable template fragments
├── sass/ or css/    # Source stylesheets (sass/ for SCSS, css/ for Tailwind)
└── templates/       # Page templates (index.html, catalogue/, blog/, etc.)
```

Spark does not ship checkout templates. Checkout is platform-managed, and Spark owns the storefront cart plus the handoff to `/checkout/`.

### Identify the Theme Family First

Do this before copying patterns between reference themes:

| Theme family | Markers | Use these patterns |
|--------------|---------|--------------------|
| **Spark** | `css/input.css`, committed `assets/main.css`, `scripts/sass-compat.py`, `assets/js/spark-cart.js`, `assets/js/components/spark-*`, `DESIGN.md` | Tailwind v4 standalone CLI, vanilla JS/Web Components, GraphQL-first side cart, fixed-order homepage section partials, app hooks |
| **Intro Bootstrap** | `sass/main.scss`, Bootstrap classes, `assets/js/cart.js`, `assets/js/side_cart.js`, jQuery before `{% core_js %}` | Bootstrap 5, SCSS, platform side cart scripts, jQuery/core_js integration |
| **Custom theme** | Mixed or merchant-specific structure | Preserve the local stack. Inspect README/CLAUDE/DESIGN docs before adding tools or renaming conventions |

Intro Bootstrap is a strong reference for DTL patterns, template contexts, URL names, and older storefront conventions. Spark is the modern starter direction: zero jQuery, zero Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS v4, GraphQL-first cart components, named homepage section partials, and public app-hook surfaces. Do not port stack-specific implementation details across themes unless the current theme already uses that stack.

### Template Language

Templates use Django Template Language (DTL):

- **Inheritance:** `{% extends "layouts/base.html" %}` + `{% block content %}...{% endblock %}`
- **Includes:** `{% include "partials/header.html" %}`
- **Variables:** `{{ product.get_title }}`, `{{ settings.primary_color }}`
- **Tags:** `{% for item in products %}...{% endfor %}`, `{% if condition %}...{% endif %}`
- **Filters:** `{{ price|currency:currency_code }}`, `{{ text|truncatewords:10 }}`

### Settings System

Theme settings let merchants customize their store without code:

- `settings_schema.json` defines the editor UI — groups of fields with types like `text`, `color`, `image_picker`, `select`, `menu`, `checkbox`
- `settings_data.json` stores the current live Theme Editor values
- Templates access values via `{{ settings.field_name }}`

**Settings Information Architecture:**
- **Organize by merchant mental model**, not developer taxonomy — use "Side Cart" not "Advanced > Cart Configuration"
- **5+ settings = own top-level section** — don't bury 14 cart settings inside a generic "Advanced" group
- **Use merchant-friendly labels** — "Suggested Products" not "Upsells", "Cart Title" not "cart_header_title"
- **Treat `settings_data.json` as merchant state, not code** — pushing it can overwrite Theme Editor changes made in the dashboard. For new controls, add the field/default to `settings_schema.json` and make templates handle missing values with `|default` or explicit fallback logic. Only push `settings_data.json` when intentionally changing the store's saved setting values.
- **Keep dev-only values out of the schema** — implementation details (e.g., `upsell_fallback_slots`) belong in `settings_data.json` defaults, not in the editor UI
- **Reward thresholds:** Core Spark ships one default threshold pair (`usd_goal_1`, `usd_goal_2`) with merchant-facing labels like "Free Shipping Threshold" and "Free Gift Threshold." Do not add hard-coded currency fields to a public starter unless the merchant specifically needs them. Theme developers can extend `partials/block_cart_progress_wrapper.html` and `settings_schema.json` for store-specific currency rules.
- **Geo/currency runtime data:** Templates can read active `currencies`, `storefront_geos`, `geo`, and `request.CURRENCY_CODE`, but `settings_schema.json` is static editor configuration. Do not assume Theme Settings can automatically generate fields from the store's configured markets.
- **Group ordering gotcha:** Display order is determined by first-seen in `settings_schema.json`, not JSON key order. Renaming a group key makes it appear last in the editor

## Reference Documentation

For detailed reference on template tags, objects, filters, and settings types, use the public developer docs first. These are the source of truth — consult them before writing template code.

| Topic | Public docs |
|-------|-----------|
| Template tags | `https://developers.nextcommerce.com/docs/storefront/themes/templates/tags` |
| Template filters | `https://developers.nextcommerce.com/docs/storefront/themes/templates/filters` |
| Template objects | `https://developers.nextcommerce.com/docs/storefront/themes/templates/objects` |
| URLs & template paths | `https://developers.nextcommerce.com/docs/storefront/themes/templates/urls-and-template-paths` |
| Settings field types | `https://developers.nextcommerce.com/docs/storefront/themes/settings` |
| Translations / i18n | `https://developers.nextcommerce.com/docs/storefront/themes/translations` |
| Storefront GraphQL API | `https://developers.nextcommerce.com/docs/storefront/graphql` |

If a local `developer-docs` checkout is available, it is useful for source-level docs changes and exact MDX references. Public merchant guidance should still point to `developers.nextcommerce.com`, not local absolute paths.

When you need to know what variables a template has access to, the objects reference includes a **Template Contexts** table that maps every template path to its available view-specific variables, plus a **Dashboard Cross-Reference** showing where variable data is configured in the admin.

## Critical Warnings

These will silently break things if ignored:

### Full-Page Caching: The Server vs. Client Boundary

This is the most important architectural constraint in Next Commerce themes. All storefront pages are **fully cached for 5 minutes** on mapped domains. The cache is keyed by URL + language + currency combination — so each locale variant (EN+USD, FR+EUR, etc.) has its own cached page, and all visitors with that same locale see the same cached HTML.

This means product pricing is safe in templates (it varies by currency, and the cache handles that). But per-user data — cart, authentication, wishlists — is unique to each individual and fundamentally incompatible with page caching.

**Server-side templates (DTL) are for public content (same for all visitors in a locale):**
- Product details, pricing, categories, blog posts, pages
- Store info, settings-driven UI, navigation menus
- SEO metadata, structured data

**Client-side JavaScript (via GraphQL API) is required for per-user content:**
- Cart state (item count, totals, line items)
- User authentication state (logged in/out, username)
- Wishlists, saved items, order history

Never put `{{ cart.num_items }}` or `{{ user.is_authenticated }}` in a cached template — one user's data gets served to everyone in that locale. This is why Next Commerce themes don't show a cart item counter in the nav by default — displaying it requires a client-side GraphQL call on every page load, which is an intentional performance tradeoff.

```
SAFE in templates (cached per locale)    REQUIRES GraphQL (per-user, client-side JS)
─────────────────────────────────────    ──────────────────────────────────────────
{{ product.get_title }}                  Cart contents, count, totals
{{ session.price.price|currency:... }}   User login state / profile
{{ settings.* }}                         Wishlists, saved items
{{ store.name }}, {{ menus.*.items }}    Order history
Product prices, categories, filters      Checkout state
```

The `/cart/`, `/checkout/`, and `/accounts/` paths are excluded from full-page caching, but any content in shared layouts (headers, footers via `layouts/base.html`) renders on every cached page.

### Compiled CSS Must Be Committed (Installable Themes)

The platform does not compile CSS server-side. Build tools (Tailwind binary, npm, Sass CLIs) are not preserved on `ntk push` and don't come down on `ntk pull`. This means **the compiled, minified output (`assets/main.css` for Tailwind themes, the compiled CSS for SCSS themes that build locally) MUST be committed to the repo** for the theme to be installable.

If `assets/main.css` is gitignored:
- Cloning the repo gives a styled-broken theme
- Pulling via ntk gives a styled-broken theme
- The merchant has to install a Tailwind toolchain just to get a working storefront

The right pattern:
- **Gitignore the binary** (`tailwindcss`, `node_modules/`) — platform-specific, large, and not needed at install time
- **Commit the artifact** (`assets/main.css`) — small, what actually ships, makes the theme self-contained
- **Add a `make release` (or equivalent) target** that rebuilds + stages the artifact so source and output stay in sync
- **Document the contract** in CLAUDE.md / README so future devs don't re-gitignore the artifact thinking it's "build output"

Treat the committed `main.css` as a versioned artifact. Drift between `css/input.css` and the committed output is a bug to be fixed before the next push, not a normal state.

### Tailwind + DTL: No Dynamic Class Construction

Never build Tailwind class names with template variables:
```django
{# BAD — Tailwind's purge scanner can't see runtime values #}
<div class="bg-{{ settings.primary_color }}">

{# GOOD — use CSS custom properties #}
<style>:root { --primary-color: {{ settings.primary_color|default:"#1E293B" }}; }</style>
<div class="bg-[var(--primary-color)]">
```

Tailwind scans source files at build time to determine which classes to include. Template variables only resolve at runtime on the server, so dynamically constructed class names get purged from the CSS output.

### No Non-ASCII in JavaScript Files

The platform processes all theme files through the DTL engine, including `.js` files. Non-ASCII characters (curly quotes, em dashes, emoji) in JS files cause encoding errors. Stick to plain ASCII in all JavaScript.

### ntk Push: Only Changed Files

Always push specific files, never the entire theme:
```bash
# Good
ntk push templates/index.html
ntk push assets/main.css configs/settings_schema.json

# Bad — pushes everything, slow, unnecessary
ntk push
```

Be especially careful with `configs/settings_data.json`: it is the store's saved Theme Editor state. Do not include it in a push just because you added a schema field. Prefer schema defaults plus template fallbacks:
```django
{% if not settings.hide_media_bar %}
    {# media bar #}
{% endif %}
```

Push `settings_data.json` only when the task explicitly requires updating current saved values, and call that out in the summary.

### jQuery Before core_js (Intro Bootstrap / jQuery Themes)

Intro Bootstrap and other jQuery themes must load jQuery before the platform's `{% core_js %}` tag:
```django
<script src="{{ 'jquery.min.js'|asset_url }}"></script>
{% core_js %}
```

Spark does not use jQuery or `{% core_js %}`. It uses `assets/js/spark-platform.js` plus Spark Web Components instead.

### CDN Caching

CloudFront aggressively caches assets and full pages (5 min on mapped domains):
- **Always develop on the `.29next.store` network domain** — it bypasses full-page caching
- Append `?skip_cache` to a URL for edge cases
- When a page looks reverted after a push, verify the same URL with `?preview_theme={theme_id}&skip_cache=1` before assuming files or settings were lost
- Template changes via ntk automatically bust the template cache
- Asset changes (CSS/JS) may take a moment to propagate on CDN

### DTL Comments: Single-Line Only

Django template comments must be single-line. Multi-line comment blocks render as visible text:
```django
{# This is correct — single line #}

{# This is WRONG —
   it will render as visible text on the page #}
```

### Anti-Slop Design Rules

When building or modifying theme UI, enforce these rules to avoid generic "AI-generated" aesthetics:
- No 3-column icon grids (the default lazy layout)
- No centered-everything layouts
- No generic hero text ("Welcome to our store")
- No uniform rounded corners on everything
- No default blue buttons
- No decorative gradient blobs or abstract shapes
- No emoji in UI elements
- Default `text-sm` (14px) feels too small for marketing storefronts — prefer `text-base` (16px) for body copy
- In Spark, follow the theme's own `DESIGN.md`: sharp, minimal commerce UI; no Bootstrap imports, jQuery patterns, or app-dashboard design tokens

### Text Sizing

For marketing-forward storefronts, `text-sm` (14px) as the body default feels cramped. Use `text-base` (16px) minimum for body copy. Headlines should have clear hierarchy — don't let Tailwind defaults flatten your type scale.

## Known Gotchas

Hard-won lessons from building Spark. These will silently break things if you don't know about them.

| Gotcha | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Product picker returns parent PK** | `settings.gift_product` gives the parent product PK. For cart operations (addCartLines), use `.children.first.pk` to get the variant ID |
| **Settings group ordering** | Group display order = first-seen in `settings_schema.json`, not JSON key order. Renaming a group makes it appear last |
| **Settings schema shape** | `settings_schema.json` is top-level section -> group -> array of setting objects. Do not use ad hoc object maps for new public examples |
| **Spark vs Intro stack mismatch** | Spark is Tailwind + vanilla Web Components. Intro Bootstrap is Bootstrap/SCSS + jQuery/core_js. Preserve the current theme's stack |
| **Spark reward thresholds** | Spark core exposes one default reward threshold pair. Currency-specific reward rules belong in a theme-developer extension, not hard-coded starter settings |
| **manifest.json can't be pushed** | ntk excludes `manifest.json` from push/watch. Version is set at `ntk init` only |
| **Shadow DOM ≠ slotted styles** | Shadow DOM styles don't apply to slotted (light DOM) content. Fix: inject a `<style>` tag into `document.head` with a guard flag to prevent duplicates |
| **connectedCallback fires early** | `connectedCallback` fires before child elements are parsed. Use a lazy `_ensureRefs()` pattern called from methods that need refs, plus `requestAnimationFrame` for initial updates |
| **Concurrent mutation guard** | Cart mutations must use an `_isMutating` flag to prevent race conditions from rapid clicks (e.g., quantity +/+ before first response returns) |
| **sass-compat is required** | Every Tailwind build must run through `sass-compat.py`. Platform SCSS compiler rejects: `oklch()`, `color-mix()`, `@layer`, `@property`, `:is()`/`:where()`, logical properties, media range syntax |
| **Spark app hooks are extension surfaces** | Use existing `{% app_hook %}` slots before forking Spark templates for app integrations |
| **Preview URL** | `https://{store}/?preview_theme={theme_id}` — useful for testing unpublished theme changes |
| **ntk accepted directories** | Only these are recognized: assets, checkout, configs, layouts, partials, templates, locales, sass. Files outside these are silently ignored |
| **Asset path mapping** | A local file like `assets/img/merchant/hero.jpg` is uploaded as `assets/img/merchant/hero.jpg`, but templates reference it without the `assets/` prefix: `{{ 'img/merchant/hero.jpg'|asset_url }}` |
| **Figma export overlays** | Figma frames often include labels, badges, card UI, shadows, or text that Spark also renders. Inspect the node tree before export; export the clean underlying image/fill when the overlay is theme UI |
| **Build artifacts must be committed** | The platform doesn't compile CSS/JS server-side and doesn't preserve binaries on push. Compiled `assets/main.css` (Tailwind) or compiled CSS (build-time SCSS) must be checked in or the theme is unstyled on install. Gitignore the toolchain (binaries, `node_modules/`), commit the artifact |

---

## Dashboard-Theme Bridge

Some theme features require **both** theme settings AND dashboard configuration to work correctly. The theme handles the UI, but the actual discount/shipping logic lives in Dashboard > Marketing > Offers.

| Feature | Theme Side | Dashboard Side |
|---------|-----------|----------------|
| Free shipping progress bar | Settings: threshold amount, progress messages, bar UI | Requires: Conditional free shipping Offer matching the threshold |
| Free gift auto-add | Settings: gift product picker, threshold, auto-add JS | Requires: Conditional discount Offer that makes the gift $0 |
| Suggested products | Settings: product pickers, display logic | No Offer needed (products added at full price) |
| Discount codes | Coupon input UI in cart | Requires: Discount code created in Dashboard |

**Without the matching Offer, the theme UI will promise something it can't deliver** — e.g., the progress bar says "Free shipping at $50!" but checkout still charges shipping.

When adding these settings to `settings_schema.json`, include help text pointing merchants to the relevant dashboard setup. A link to documentation is the minimum viable approach.

---

## Design to Theme Workflow

Step-by-step process for assembling a working theme from a design file. This is the primary workflow for the marketer persona.

### Step 1: Design Intake

Accept any of: Figma link, screenshot, PDF, or verbal description. Extract:
- **Color palette** — primary, secondary, accent, neutrals, backgrounds
- **Typography** — font families, size scale, weight usage, line heights
- **Spacing system** — section padding, component gaps, content margins
- **Component inventory** — header, footer, hero, product cards, CTAs, nav, cart drawer
- **Static vs dynamic split** — which elements show the same content for all visitors (DTL) vs per-user content (GraphQL)

Identify the theme family before implementation. Spark designs should map to Tailwind tokens, Web Components, homepage section partials, and app hooks. Intro Bootstrap designs should map to Bootstrap/SCSS and the existing jQuery/platform side cart where present. If a `DESIGN.md` exists in the project, it is the **source of truth** for all visual decisions. Read it before making UI choices.

### Step 1.5: Figma Fidelity Loop

When a Figma source is provided, treat the Figma file as a visual spec, not merely an asset bucket. Do not require the user to repeatedly ask for closer matching. Run this loop by default until the remaining deltas are explicit.

1. **Map the design.** Identify the Figma file key, desktop/tablet/mobile frames, page/frame names, and section order. Record which storefront route/template each frame maps to.
2. **Classify every section before building.** Decide what should be semantic HTML/CSS, what should use live platform data, what should be an exported image/vector asset, and what is intentionally a static composed frame. Text, buttons, controls, product selectors, prices, tables, FAQs, and nav/footer links should normally be rendered by the theme, not baked into a screenshot.
3. **Extract the smallest real assets.** Inspect children, fills, masks, vectors, and hidden variants. Export the underlying image fill/vector node or intended composed asset. Full-frame exports are diagnostic unless the design intentionally calls for a static bitmap composition.
4. **Assemble semantically.** Build sections with real DTL/HTML, CSS, accessible controls, and platform contracts. Use extracted assets only for visual media, logos, product art, iconography, or intentional composites.
5. **Push and compare.** After upload, capture the preview URL and the matching Figma frame/section at the same viewport. Compare section-by-section for image crop, asset choice, typography, spacing, alignment, colors, text wrapping, CTA size, touch targets, footer/header, and responsive behavior.
6. **Create a remediation queue.** For each mismatch, mark it `fix-now`, `intentional-platform-divergence`, or `blocked-input-needed`. Platform divergences include Spark PDP gallery behavior, live variant pickers, backend product imagery, app hooks, cart/auth state, and other dynamic commerce surfaces.
7. **Repeat.** Patch the `fix-now` items, push changed files only, and re-run visual/DOM checks. Continue until the page is close to Figma or every remaining difference is explicitly documented for the user.

If the task covers several pages, walk one page or section group at a time. It is acceptable to use subagents for independent section audits, but give them raw Figma/build screenshots or URLs and ask for deltas, not implementation conclusions.

**Hard stop:** Do not ship a page made mostly of full-section screenshots as a shortcut unless the user explicitly asks for a static visual prototype. A photocopy can be useful for diagnosis, but production storefronts should preserve text, links, controls, SEO, accessibility, live product data, and responsive behavior.

### Step 2: Asset Preparation

This is the **#1 time bottleneck** — design assets are merchant-specific and can't be templated.

- **Fonts:** Convert to `.woff2`, create `@font-face` declarations in CSS, add font files to `assets/`
- **Images:** Hero images, product photography, lifestyle shots, product cutouts, and press logos must come from the merchant or the design source. Use placeholders only while blocked, and replace them before QA
- **Figma sources:** Never ship diagnostic screenshots, frame previews, or thumbnail exports as production imagery unless the design explicitly calls for that thumbnail. Inspect the Figma layer tree and export the original image fill, vector node, or intended composed asset.
- **Icons:** Prefer inline SVG (smallest payload, style-able) or an icon font. Avoid individual image files for icons
- **Optimization:** All assets serve via CDN. Keep routine images under 200KB when quality allows. `ntk` supports WebP, but the current accepted extension list does not include AVIF. Optimize after confirming the correct source asset and assembling the design, not before asset selection.
- **Manifest:** For merchant-specific exports, keep an export checklist or manifest mapping Figma node IDs to local filenames. Prefer `docs/<merchant>-asset-manifest.json` so source metadata does not become a CDN-served storefront asset. Use `assets/img/<merchant>/manifest.json` only when the manifest is intentionally public and contains no internal design provenance.

### Figma Asset Export Runbook

Use this runbook before exporting design assets into Spark. The main rule: **do not export a visible Figma frame until you know whether it is the real asset or a composed UI artifact.**

Diagnostic screenshots, frame exports, and thumbnails are useful for orientation only. They must not become the shipped build asset unless the storefront UI is actually a thumbnail or the whole visible Figma composition is intentionally meant to be one static bitmap. When in doubt, find the original image fill or clean vector underneath the frame.

**Identify the file key and node IDs**

- Figma design URLs have this shape: `https://www.figma.com/design/<file_key>/<file_name>?node-id=<node_id>`.
- The `file_key` is the path segment after `/design/` or `/file/`.
- The URL `node-id` usually appears with hyphens, such as `123-456`; Figma APIs and tools may return the same node as `123:456`. Preserve the exact ID returned by the tool you are using in any manifest.
- If exporting several assets from one file, record the file URL, file key, page/frame name, node ID, local filename, intended usage, and export scale.

**Inspect the node hierarchy before export**

Before exporting, inspect the layer tree and answer:

- Is the selected node a frame/card/section, a vector/logo layer, a masked image fill, or a nested bitmap?
- Are badges, prices, review stars, CTA text, shadows, gradients, or decorative labels children of the node?
- Is the asset clipped by a mask or frame that hides important subject matter on mobile?
- Does the node contain a clean image fill that should be exported instead of the containing frame?
- Are there hidden variants or responsive frames with cleaner desktop/mobile crops?

When using Figma MCP/API tools, fetch only the relevant node context, inspect children/visibility/fills, then export the smallest node that represents the intended asset.

**Export frames versus underlying fills**

- Export a frame when the whole composition is meant to be one static bitmap, such as a hero collage, UGC strip, lifestyle mosaic, or editorial block with intentionally baked layout.
- Export an underlying fill/image node when Spark will render the surrounding card, product title, price, CTA, sale badge, label, shadow, border, or responsive crop.
- Export a vector/SVG node when it is a clean logo or icon and does not contain raster screenshots, unwanted masks, or text that should remain rendered by the theme rather than baked into the asset.
- If the only available node is a composed product card, duplicate it in Figma or ask the designer/merchant for the source image, then hide the UI children before export.

**Badge doubling warning**

Always audit promotional labels in three places:

- Product/source image pixels: discount badges, "best value" stickers, price callouts, review badges, or guarantee marks baked into the image.
- Spark-rendered UI: product cards, PDP price blocks, on-sale sections, cart upsells, or custom homepage cards that add live sale labels.
- Dashboard/product pricing: compare-at/retail price states that cause Spark to render sale pricing or badges.

Only one layer should communicate the same discount. If product art already includes a "Save 50%" badge, disable/remove the Spark badge for that placement or export clean product art. If Spark needs live sale state, product art must be clean.

**Media and press logos**

- Export each logo as an individual transparent PNG or clean SVG, not as text typed into the theme.
- Preserve brand proportions. Set CSS max dimensions on the strip, but do not crop logos into identical boxes unless the design intentionally normalizes them.
- Use meaningful `alt` text for press/brand logos, such as `Women's Health`, `FOX`, or `The Verge`. If a repeated decorative logo is already announced in adjacent text, use empty `alt=""`.
- Prefer monochrome/grayscale treatment in CSS when possible; do not permanently recolor brand logos unless the design source and brand usage allow it.
- Verify the strip uses `<img>` elements backed by exported assets. Text fallbacks are acceptable only while blocked and should not survive final QA when the design uses real logos.

**Deterministic asset names**

Use lowercase, kebab-case names under a merchant folder:

```text
assets/img/<merchant>/hero.jpg
assets/img/<merchant>/product-knee.png
assets/img/<merchant>/logos/womens-health.png
assets/img/<merchant>/pdp/how-pull-on.png
```

Name by storefront role, not the raw Figma layer name. Avoid spaces, version suffixes like `final-final`, and opaque export names like `Frame 184.png`. Record source node IDs in a manifest instead of encoding them into filenames.

**Format selection**

- **PNG:** Transparent logos, product cutouts, UI composites with alpha, or images that must preserve crisp edges.
- **JPG/JPEG:** Opaque photography and lifestyle imagery where smaller files matter more than transparency.
- **SVG:** Clean vector logos/icons with no unwanted embedded raster, no design-only text, and acceptable brand usage. Omit `requires_alpha` for SVG entries; the validator treats SVG transparency as not mechanically provable.
- **WebP:** Opaque or transparent optimized images when the theme/storefront target supports it; `ntk` accepts `.webp`.
- **AVIF:** Do not rely on it for theme pushes unless the local `ntk` accepted extension list has been updated; current known `ntk` patterns do not include `.avif`.

**Verify dimensions, transparency, and paths**

- Check actual dimensions after export and put matching `width`/`height` attributes in templates to reduce layout shift.
- Confirm transparent logos/product cutouts have an alpha channel. A white-background logo exported as PNG is still wrong if the design expects transparency.
- Confirm file size and visual quality after compression. Do not crush medical/product detail just to hit an arbitrary byte target.
- Local asset files live under `assets/`, but `asset_url` paths are relative to the asset root. Example: `assets/img/merchant-slug/hero.jpg` renders as `{{ 'img/merchant-slug/hero.jpg'|asset_url }}`.
- `ntk` pushes nested asset paths as their relative template names, such as `assets/img/merchant-slug/logos/press-logo.png`. Push exact changed files: `ntk push assets/img/merchant-slug/logos/press-logo.png partials/home.html`.
- Root-level `manifest.json` is not part of the `ntk` accepted patterns. JSON under `assets/**/*.json`, `configs/**/*.json`, and `locales/**/*.json` is accepted. Do not store Figma file keys, node IDs, review notes, or clean-export attestations under `assets/` unless you are comfortable publishing that metadata through the storefront CDN.

**Manifest pattern**

Use a small JSON manifest when a design export has more than a few files or when product art/logos are easy to confuse:

```json
{
  "figma_file_key": "<figma_file_key>",
  "merchant": "merchant-slug",
  "assets": [
    {
      "path": "assets/img/merchant-slug/logos/example-magazine.png",
      "asset_url_path": "img/merchant-slug/logos/example-magazine.png",
      "figma_node_id": "<node_id>",
      "role": "press-logo",
      "alt": "Example Magazine",
      "expected_width": 148,
      "expected_height": 28,
      "requires_alpha": true,
      "max_bytes": 50000
    },
    {
      "path": "assets/img/merchant-slug/product-cutout.png",
      "asset_url_path": "img/merchant-slug/product-cutout.png",
      "figma_node_id": "<node_id>",
      "role": "clean-product-art",
      "alt": "Compression sleeve product cutout",
      "expected_width": 374,
      "expected_height": 312,
      "requires_alpha": true,
      "forbid_badges": true,
      "clean_export_verified": true
    }
  ]
}
```

The helper script at `scripts/validate-theme-assets.py` validates manifest paths, dimensions, alpha requirements, max file size, naming, expected `asset_url` paths, and explicit clean-export confirmations:

```bash
cd /path/to/skills/next-theme-dev
python3 -m pip install Pillow
python3 scripts/validate-theme-assets.py \
  --theme /path/to/theme \
  --manifest docs/<merchant>-asset-manifest.json
```

The script cannot OCR an image or prove a badge is absent. It makes that limitation explicit by requiring `clean_export_verified: true` when `forbid_badges` or `forbid_baked_text` is set.

**Visual QA checks**

- Open the preview URL and scroll every lazy-loaded asset section into view. Watch the Network panel or DOM for broken images.
- Compare product cards, homepage product tiles, PDP galleries, and cart upsells for duplicated discount labels.
- Confirm media/press logos render as images, not fallback text, and that alt text is sensible.
- Check mobile crops at 375px and 390px widths. Product, joint/body, or logo subject matter should not be clipped out of the important region.
- Hard-refresh or add `?skip_cache=1` after asset pushes if the CDN appears stale.

### Step 3: Settings Schema Design

Map design tokens to merchant-configurable settings in `configs/settings_schema.json`:

1. **Colors** → `color` type fields (primary, secondary, accent, background)
2. **Fonts** → `text` type fields for font family names
3. **Feature toggles** → `checkbox` type fields (show/hide sections)
4. **Content** → `text` fields for headlines, CTAs, placeholder copy
5. **Navigation** → `menu` type fields linked to dashboard menus
6. **Products** → `product` type fields for featured/upsell products

Follow the Settings IA principles: organize by merchant mental model, 5+ settings get their own section, use merchant-friendly labels.

### Step 4: Template Assembly

Build order:
1. **`layouts/base.html`** — CSS custom properties from settings, global head/scripts, header/footer includes
2. **Partials** — One per design component (`partials/header.html`, `partials/footer.html`, `partials/product_card.html`, etc.)
3. **Page templates** — `templates/index.html`, `templates/catalogue/product.html`, etc. using `{% extends %}` and `{% block %}`
4. **Cart/user features** — Client-side only via GraphQL + Web Components (see Side Cart recipe)

### Step 5: Styling

- Spark/Tailwind themes: configure tokens in `css/input.css`, compile to committed `assets/main.css`, and run `scripts/sass-compat.py`
- Intro Bootstrap/SCSS themes: use the existing `sass/` entrypoint and Bootstrap variable/utility patterns
- Wire CSS custom properties from theme settings in `layouts/base.html`:
  ```django
  <style>:root { --primary: {{ settings.primary_color|default:"#1E293B" }}; }</style>
  ```
- For Tailwind output, **run sass-compat.py before every push** (required — platform rejects modern CSS)
- Test responsive breakpoints: mobile (375px), tablet (768px), desktop (1280px+)

### Step 6: Client-Side Features

For per-user content (cart, auth, wishlists):
- Use GraphQL API at `/api/graphql/` with CSRF token
- Build as Web Components (Shadow DOM + light DOM hybrid)
- Dispatch events on `document` for cross-component communication
- Store cart ID in `sessionStorage` + cookie

### Step 7: Verify & Deploy

1. Preview unpublished changes: `https://{store}/?preview_theme={theme_id}`
2. Always test on `.29next.store` domain (bypasses CDN full-page cache)
3. Push only changed files: `ntk push templates/index.html partials/header.html`
4. Check dashboard-side requirements: free shipping/gift features need matching Offers (see Dashboard-Theme Bridge)
5. Verify cart operations work end-to-end (add, remove, quantity change, checkout)

## Task Recipes

### Change Colors or Fonts

1. Add fields to `configs/settings_schema.json`:
```json
{
  "Theme Styles": {
    "Colors": [
      { "name": "primary_color", "type": "color", "label": "Primary Color", "default": "#1E293B" }
    ],
    "Typography": [
      { "name": "body_font", "type": "text", "label": "Body Font Family", "default": "system-ui, sans-serif" }
    ]
  }
}
```

2. Wire into `layouts/base.html` via CSS custom properties:
```django
<style>
:root {
    --primary-color: {{ settings.primary_color|default:"#1E293B" }};
    --body-font: {{ settings.body_font|default:"system-ui, sans-serif" }};
}
</style>
```

3. Push both files: `ntk push configs/settings_schema.json layouts/base.html`

### Add a Custom Page Template

1. For the default page template, modify or create `templates/pages/page.html`. For a custom page template selectable from the dashboard/API, create `templates/pages/page.{template_name}.html`:
```django
{% extends "layouts/base.html" %}
{% block content %}
<div class="container">
    <h1>{% if page.title %}{{ page.title }}{% else %}{{ flatpage.title }}{% endif %}</h1>
    <div>{% if page.content %}{{ page.content|safe }}{% else %}{{ flatpage.content|safe }}{% endif %}</div>
</div>
{% endblock %}
```

2. Push: `ntk push templates/pages/page.html` or `ntk push templates/pages/page.{template_name}.html`.
3. Create or update the Page record in the dashboard and select the custom template. If using the Admin API, set `template` to `{template_name}` for `page.{template_name}.html`; leave it blank for the default `page.html`.
4. Verify the actual storefront route. Many Next Commerce flatpages route at `/<slug>/`, not `/pages/<slug>/`. Do not hardcode page links until a `curl -I` or browser check confirms the store's route shape.

**Admin API page creation:** `ntk` manages theme files only; it does not create dashboard Page records. If an admin token has `content:write`, create pages through the Admin API:

```bash
curl -sS -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title":"Our Technology","slug":"our-technology","content":"<p>Theme-rendered page.</p>","template":"","meta_title":"Our Technology","meta_description":"..."}' \
  "https://{store}.29next.store/api/admin/pages/"
```

After creation, verify the route with the preview theme:

```bash
curl -I "https://{store}.29next.store/{slug}/?preview_theme={theme_id}&skip_cache=1"
```

**Context gotcha:** Some page routes expose `page.title`, `page.content`, and `page.slug`; older Spark examples use `flatpage.title`, `flatpage.content`, and `flatpage.url`. For merchant templates that need to be portable, support `page.*` first and keep `flatpage.*` as a fallback.

### Add a Custom Product Template

1. Create `templates/catalogue/product.{slug}.html` (the slug must match the product's URL slug):
```django
{% extends "layouts/base.html" %}
{% load core_tags %}
{% block content %}
    {# Custom product layout #}
{% endblock %}
```

2. Push: `ntk push templates/catalogue/product.{slug}.html`

### Custom Spark PDP Redesigns

Spark PDP work is behavior preservation first, visual matching second. A static Figma PDP can look correct while silently breaking variant matching, price updates, cart submission, subscriptions, reviews, or app tracking.

Before changing `templates/catalogue/product.html`, read the local Spark docs if available:

- `docs/pdp-customization.md` - PDP redesign preservation checklist, QA runbook, and partialization guidance
- `docs/pdp-variant-state.md` - selected-variant Interface for picker, price, gallery, and add-to-cart adapters

**Preservation checklist:**

| Surface | Preserve this |
| --- | --- |
| Product data JSON | Keep `{{ product.data|json_script:"product-data" }}` in `extrascripts`; `SparkVariantState` depends on `#product-data`. |
| Variant controls | Keep real controls named `attr_<code>` from `variant_form`. Custom swatches/buttons must update those real controls and values. |
| Price bindings | Keep a visible price node with `data-price` and a compare-at node with `data-price-retail`, hidden when empty. |
| Quantity | Keep a real `quantity` field or `<spark-quantity name="quantity">` inside the cart form. |
| Add-to-cart form | Keep `id="add-to-cart"`, CSRF, hidden `cart_form` fields, submit button, and POST action to `{% url 'cart:add' pk=product.pk %}`. |
| Subscription hooks | Preserve `<spark-subscription>` when `product.get_interval` and `interval_count_choices` exist. |
| App hooks | Preserve PDP app hooks such as `product_rating_summary`, `product_info`, `product_footer`, `product_reviews`, `product_review_cta`, `view_product`, and `add_to_cart`. |
| Inventory states | Preserve `session.availability.is_available_to_buy` branches and selected-variant CTA disablement. |
| Sticky/mobile CTA | The sticky CTA should click the real submit button; it should not duplicate cart logic. Check that it does not cover content on mobile. |
| Fallbacks | Products with no image, incomplete product data, no reviews, or no JS should still render usable UI. |

Missing product data, `attr_*` controls, price bindings, CSRF/quantity/cart fields, app hooks, or sold-out behavior is a hard stop before upload unless the merchant explicitly accepts that behavior change.

**Safe picker pattern:** visual markup can change, but the underlying control name and value must come from `variant_form`.

```django
{% for field in variant_form %}
    {% if 'attr' in field.id_for_label %}
        {% for choice in field.field.choices %}
            <label>
                <input type="radio" name="{{ field.html_name }}" value="{{ choice.0 }}">
                <span>{{ choice.1 }}</span>
            </label>
        {% endfor %}
    {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
```

**DOM smoke audit:** run this in the browser console after a redesign. It catches missing contracts, but it does not replace selecting variants and actually adding to cart.

```js
(function() {
  var form = document.getElementById('add-to-cart');
  var controls = Array.prototype.slice.call(document.querySelectorAll('[name^="attr_"]'));
  console.table({
    productData: !!document.getElementById('product-data'),
    variantControls: controls.length,
    variantNames: Array.from(new Set(controls.map(function(control) { return control.name; }))).join(', '),
    priceNode: !!document.querySelector('[data-price]'),
    retailPriceNode: !!document.querySelector('[data-price-retail]'),
    addToCartForm: !!form,
    csrf: !!(form && form.querySelector('[name="csrfmiddlewaretoken"]')),
    quantity: !!(form && form.querySelector('[name="quantity"], spark-quantity')),
    submitButton: !!(form && form.querySelector('button[type="submit"]')),
    subscription: !!document.querySelector('spark-subscription'),
    stickyCta: !!document.getElementById('sticky-atc'),
    horizontalOverflow: document.documentElement.scrollWidth > window.innerWidth
  });
})();
```

**QA before push:**

1. Select all variants and confirm price, compare-at price, gallery image, form action, and CTA availability update.
2. Add to cart with quantity greater than 1 and confirm the selected child product reaches the cart.
3. Test subscription products, sold-out products, no-image products, and products with no reviews when available.
4. Check mobile widths around 375-430px for horizontal overflow and sticky CTA coverage.
5. Verify review/app hook surfaces still render or remain present for apps.

`configs/settings_data.json` is merchant Theme Editor state. Add controls to `settings_schema.json` and use template fallbacks for missing values. Push `settings_data.json` only for an intentional store-state change. RelievCore's `variant_picker = radio` change was design-relevant, but it was still merchant state and should be called out when pushed.

Do not split Spark's PDP into partials just for one merchant design. If repeated custom PDP work justifies it, prefer stable partials for gallery/media, buy box, variant picker, quantity/cart controls, trust/benefit strip, size guide, reviews, and related products.

### Add a Partial

1. Create `partials/{name}.html` with the fragment
2. Include it: `{% include "partials/{name}.html" %}`
3. Pass context if needed: `{% include "partials/product_card.html" with product=item %}`
4. Push both files

### Modify Navigation

Navigation menus are managed in Dashboard > Storefront > Navigation. The theme accesses them via the `menus` global object and a `menu` settings field:

1. Add a menu field to `configs/settings_schema.json`:
```json
{
  "Navigation": {
    "Menus": [
      { "name": "main_menu", "type": "menu", "label": "Main Navigation", "default": "main_menu" }
    ]
  }
}
```

2. Render in the template:
```django
{% for item in settings.main_menu.items %}
    <a href="{{ item.url }}" class="{% if item.current %}active{% endif %}">
        {{ item.name }}
    </a>
    {% if item.level > 0 %}
        {# Has children — render dropdown #}
        {% for child in item.items %}
            <a href="{{ child.url }}">{{ child.name }}</a>
        {% endfor %}
    {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
```

Menus support up to 3 levels of nesting. Read the objects reference for all `item` properties.

### Add Translations

1. Add keys to each locale file in `locales/`:
```json
{
  "cart": {
    "empty_message": "Your cart is empty",
    "checkout_button": "Proceed to Checkout"
  }
}
```

2. Use in templates: `{% t "cart.empty_message" %}`
3. With variables: `{% t "cart.item_count" with count=cart.num_items %}`
4. Push all changed locale files

### Cart and User State (GraphQL — Required)

Because of full-page caching, all cart and user interactions must go through the Storefront GraphQL API at `/api/graphql/`. This is not optional — server-side template variables for cart/user data will be cached and show stale or wrong data to visitors.

Use GraphQL for:
- Cart operations: `createCart`, `addCartLines`, `updateCartLines`, `removeCartLines`
- Reading cart state: `cart` query (item count, totals, line items)
- User state: `me` query (authentication, profile)
- Any data that varies per visitor

Include CSRF token in all requests:
```javascript
function getCookie(name) {
    const value = `; ${document.cookie}`;
    const parts = value.split(`; ${name}=`);
    if (parts.length === 2) return parts.pop().split(';').shift();
}

fetch('/api/graphql/', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'X-CSRFToken': getCookie('csrftoken')
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
        query: `{ cart { totalQuantity totalAmount { amount currency } } }`
    })
})
```

Read the public GraphQL reference for the full schema, all available queries/mutations, and example payloads.

### Side Cart Customization

Side carts are one of the most common theme customization requests. Start by identifying the theme family.

**Intro Bootstrap / platform side cart pattern:**
- Preserve `partials/side_cart.html`, `assets/js/cart.js`, and `assets/js/side_cart.js` unless intentionally replacing the cart stack.
- Keep jQuery before `{% core_js %}` in `layouts/base.html`.
- Style with Bootstrap 5 and existing SCSS partials.
- Use DTL for the static shell and translations, and the existing JS for cart mutations.

**Spark side cart pattern:**
- Use `assets/js/spark-cart.js` as the GraphQL cart client.
- Use `assets/js/spark-platform.js` instead of `{% core_js %}`.
- Use these Web Components: `<spark-cart-drawer>`, `<spark-progress-bar>`, `<spark-upsell-item>`, `<spark-add-to-cart>`, `<spark-quantity>`.
- Keep the shell in `partials/side_cart.html`; keep progress and suggested-product fragments in `partials/block_cart_progress_wrapper.html`, `partials/block_cart_progress_bar.html`, `partials/block_cart_upsell.html`, and `partials/block_cart_upsell_item.html`.
- Treat `partials/block_cart_progress_wrapper.html` as the extension point for merchant-specific reward threshold logic.

**Spark Theme Settings shape:**

```json
{
  "Side Cart": {
    "General": [
      { "name": "cart_header_title", "type": "text", "label": "Cart Title", "default": "Your Cart" },
      { "name": "sidecart_open_on_add", "type": "checkbox", "label": "Open Cart After Add", "default": true }
    ],
    "Rewards Progress": [
      { "name": "enable_progress_bar", "type": "checkbox", "label": "Enable Progress Bar", "default": true },
      { "name": "usd_goal_1", "type": "number", "label": "Free Shipping Threshold", "default": 50 },
      { "name": "usd_goal_2", "type": "number", "label": "Free Gift Threshold", "default": 100 },
      { "name": "gift_product", "type": "product", "label": "Free Gift Product" },
      { "name": "step_1_message", "type": "text", "label": "Shipping Message", "default": "You are {amount} away from FREE shipping" },
      { "name": "step_2_message", "type": "text", "label": "Gift Message", "default": "You are {amount} away from a FREE gift!" },
      { "name": "final_step_message", "type": "text", "label": "Complete Message", "default": "You unlocked free shipping and a free gift!" }
    ],
    "Suggested Products": [
      { "name": "enable_upsells", "type": "checkbox", "label": "Enable Suggested Products", "default": true },
      { "name": "upsell_section_title", "type": "text", "label": "Section Title", "default": "You may also like" },
      { "name": "upsell_product_1", "type": "product", "label": "Product 1" },
      { "name": "upsell_product_2", "type": "product", "label": "Product 2" },
      { "name": "upsell_product_3", "type": "product", "label": "Product 3" }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Key implementation patterns:**

- **Event bus**: Spark cart components communicate via custom events on `document`: `spark:cart:updated` (after any mutation), `spark:cart:added` (item added), `spark:cart:toggle` (open/close drawer). Other components listen on `document` for these events — no direct component coupling.

- **Cart persistence**: Cart ID stored in both `sessionStorage` (fast access) and a 30-day cookie (cross-tab persistence). On page load, check `sessionStorage` first, fall back to cookie. Always sync both after cart creation.

- **Mutation guard**: All cart mutations must check/set an `_isMutating` flag to prevent race conditions from rapid clicks (e.g., quantity +/+ before first response returns). Reset the flag in `finally` block.

- **Success validation**: Check `result.success` not `result.cart.numItems > 0`. The latter fails on empty cart after removing last item. Surface `result.errors` array for descriptive messages instead of generic "Could not add to cart".

- **Product picker PK gotcha**: `settings.gift_product` returns the parent product PK. For cart operations (`addCartLines`), use `.children.first.pk` to get the actual variant ID.

- **Reward thresholds**: Core Spark uses one default threshold pair (`usd_goal_1`, `usd_goal_2`). Do not expose hard-coded multi-currency fields in the starter. If a merchant needs store-specific currency logic, extend the wrapper partial and schema deliberately.

- **Suggested product visibility**: Products may have metadata defining which suggested-product slots to show. When the cart changes, JS checks each cart product's metadata and hides products already in the cart.

- **Free gift auto-add/remove**: When cart total crosses the gift threshold, JS automatically adds the gift product via `addCartLines` with `isUpsell: true`. When it drops below, JS removes the gift line. The gift product is configured via a `product` type theme setting. **Note:** This only adds the product to cart — making it actually free requires a matching Offer in the dashboard (see Dashboard-Theme Bridge section).

- **Cart count badge**: Updated via JS after every cart operation by selecting all `[data-cart-count]` elements in the DOM and setting their text content. This is the only way to show cart count — never use `{{ cart.num_items }}` in cached templates.

- **Web Component timing**: Load component scripts BEFORE template inclusion. Use `_ensureRefs()` lazy pattern since `connectedCallback` fires before children parse. For slotted content styling, inject `<style>` into `document.head` with a guard flag (Shadow DOM styles don't reach slotted elements).

- **Design from Figma**: When a design is provided (Figma, screenshot, or description), map visual elements to this component architecture. The CSS lives in the theme's SCSS/CSS, the behavior in the Web Components, and merchant-configurable values in theme settings.

**Files to create/modify:**

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `assets/js/spark-cart.js` | Spark GraphQL cart client |
| `assets/js/components/spark-cart-drawer.js` | Spark cart drawer Web Component |
| `assets/js/components/spark-progress-bar.js` | Spark reward progress Web Component |
| `assets/js/components/spark-upsell-item.js` | Spark suggested-product Web Component |
| `partials/side_cart.html` | Main cart drawer shell (included in `layouts/base.html`) |
| `partials/block_cart_progress_bar.html` | Progress bar with step indicators |
| `partials/block_cart_progress_wrapper.html` | Default threshold selector and extension point |
| `partials/block_cart_upsell.html` | Suggested product section |
| `partials/block_cart_upsell_item.html` | Individual suggested product row |
| `configs/settings_schema.json` | Add Side Cart settings section |
| `css/input.css` or `sass/components/_sidecart.scss` | Side cart styling, depending on theme stack |

**Important constraints:**
- No non-ASCII characters in JS files (platform processes through DTL engine)
- All cart mutations require CSRF token (`X-CSRFToken` header from `csrftoken` cookie)
- Cart ID stored in both `sessionStorage` and cookie for cross-tab persistence
- Use `Intl.NumberFormat` for client-side currency formatting (matches browser locale)
- Only push changed files with ntk, never the entire theme

---

## Deployment Workflow

### Standard (SCSS themes)

```bash
ntk watch    # Watches for changes and auto-pushes
```

ntk watch handles Sass compilation automatically — `.scss` files in `sass/` are compiled to `assets/` before pushing.

### Tailwind Themes

Spark uses the Tailwind v4 standalone CLI with no Node dependency. In Spark, prefer the project commands:

```bash
make install-tailwind   # One-time local binary install
ntk watch               # Watch templates/CSS, compile Tailwind, run sass-compat, push
ntk tailwind            # One-shot Tailwind compile + sass-compat + CSS push
make release            # Compile, run sass-compat, and stage assets/main.css
```

For custom Tailwind themes, use one of these setups:

**Standalone CLI (preferred when starting fresh).** Download the platform-specific binary from `tailwindlabs/tailwindcss` releases, gitignore it, and orchestrate via `Makefile`:

```makefile
TAILWIND = ./tailwindcss
COMPAT = python3 scripts/sass-compat.py

dev:
	@$(TAILWIND) -i css/input.css -o assets/main.css --watch &
	@ntk watch

css:
	$(TAILWIND) -i css/input.css -o assets/main.css --minify
	$(COMPAT) assets/main.css

release: css
	@git add assets/main.css
```

Add an `install-tailwind` Make target that detects the dev's OS/arch and curls the right release binary. The binary stays gitignored (76MB, platform-specific) but `assets/main.css` is **committed** (see "Compiled CSS Must Be Committed" critical warning).

**npm-based (only when the theme already has a Node toolchain).** Orchestrate via `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "npm run tailwind:watch & ntk watch",
    "build": "npm run tailwind:build && npm run compat",
    "tailwind:watch": "npx @tailwindcss/cli -i css/input.css -o assets/main.css --watch",
    "tailwind:build": "npx @tailwindcss/cli -i css/input.css -o assets/main.css --minify",
    "compat": "python3 scripts/sass-compat.py assets/main.css"
  }
}
```

```bash
npm run dev    # Runs Tailwind watcher + ntk watch concurrently
```

ntk watch detects the Tailwind CSS output (`assets/main.css`) changes and pushes automatically. If you see partial CSS on the store (rare race condition), manually push after Tailwind finishes:
```bash
ntk push assets/main.css
```

**Either option:** `assets/main.css` must be committed to the repo so the theme is installable without a local toolchain. Recompile and recommit it on every CSS source change using the theme's release/build target.

### CSS Compatibility Pipeline (Required for Tailwind themes)

The platform's SCSS compiler rejects modern CSS features. **Every Tailwind build must run through `sass-compat.py`** — this is not optional. The script strips/converts: `@property` rules, `oklch()` → hex, `color-mix()`, `@layer`, logical properties (`margin-inline`), `:is()`/`:where()` pseudo-classes, and media range syntax (`width >= 768px`).

Run the theme's CSS build any time you edit `css/input.css` or templates/partials that introduce Tailwind classes:

```bash
make css          # compile Tailwind and run sass-compat
make css-check    # make css, then fail if generated CSS still has unsafe constructs
make verify-theme # preferred pre-upload/release check when present
```

`assets/main.css` is the uploaded artifact. The platform does not compile Tailwind or preserve local binaries on `ntk push`, so a theme can look correct locally and still ship broken styling if the generated CSS is stale, missing, or contains unsupported compiler syntax. Treat `assets/main.css` drift as a bug: rebuild and commit/push it with the source change.

Known risky generated CSS:

- `@supports`, `@property`, `@layer`
- `oklch()` and newer color functions
- `color-mix()` unless the local compat helper has an explicit safe conversion
- `:is()` / `:where()`
- logical properties such as `margin-inline`, `padding-block`, and `inset-inline-start`
- media range syntax such as `(width >= 768px)`
- scientific-notation lengths such as `3.40282e38px`
- `min()`, `max()`, and `clamp()` when debugging compiler-specific failures; do not ban these blindly unless the target platform path proves they fail

Add the compat step to the build pipeline:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "npm run tailwind:watch & ntk watch",
    "build": "npm run tailwind:build && npm run compat",
    "tailwind:watch": "npx @tailwindcss/cli -i css/input.css -o assets/main.css --watch",
    "tailwind:build": "npx @tailwindcss/cli -i css/input.css -o assets/main.css --minify",
    "compat": "python3 scripts/sass-compat.py"
  }
}
```

The compat script should be boring and predictable: transform only known patterns, fail loudly when unsupported CSS remains, and never silently "fix" unfamiliar syntax by guessing. If the theme has no checker yet, add one around `scripts/sass-compat.py --check assets/main.css` or a dedicated `make css-check` target.

Before upload, scan the generated artifact:

```bash
python3 scripts/sass-compat.py --check assets/main.css
ntk push assets/main.css
```

Troubleshooting CSS failures:

- **Local Tailwind/build failure:** `make css` fails before upload. Fix `css/input.css`, the local Tailwind binary, or the command setup.
- **Platform Sass/compiler failure:** local build passes but upload/storefront CSS parsing fails. Run `make css-check`; the failure should point to an unsupported construct and file. Minimize the generated CSS if needed, then extend `sass-compat.py` only for a safe, known transform.
- **CDN/cache issue:** pushed CSS is correct but the storefront looks stale. Test on the `.29next.store` domain, hard-refresh, or append `?skip_cache=1`.
- **Missing uploaded compiled CSS:** templates changed but styling did not. Rebuild `assets/main.css` and push that file explicitly.

Avoid dynamic Tailwind classes in DTL templates. Tailwind only emits classes it can see at build time, so `bg-{{ settings.primary_color }}` and string-built utilities disappear from `assets/main.css`. Use CSS custom properties (`bg-[var(--primary-color)]`) or static conditionals that include complete class names.

## Debugging

### Common ntk Errors

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| `401 Unauthorized` | Bad API key or expired | Regenerate key in Dashboard > Settings > API Keys |
| `404 Not Found` | Wrong theme_id or store URL | Run `ntk list` to verify, check `config.yml` |
| `File not in valid path` | File outside recognized theme directories | Check file is in assets/, configs/, layouts/, locales/, partials/, sass/, templates/, or an optional checkout/ directory |
| `Connection refused` | Store URL wrong or store offline | Verify `store` value in config.yml uses the `.29next.store` domain |

### Template Syntax Errors

Template errors show as 500 pages on the storefront. Common causes:
- Unclosed tags (`{% if %}` without `{% endif %}`)
- Wrong variable paths (`product.title` vs `product.get_title`)
- Missing `{% load %}` tags for custom template tag libraries
- Using `{% url 'name' %}` with wrong URL name — check the URLs reference

To debug: check the store's `.29next.store` domain (bypasses caching), look at the browser's network tab for 500 responses, and read the error message in the response body.

### GraphQL Issues

- **403 Forbidden:** Missing or invalid CSRF token. Ensure you're reading the `csrftoken` cookie and sending it as `X-CSRFToken` header.
- **Queries return null:** Check field names against the GraphQL schema. Use the interactive explorer at `https://{store}.29next.store/api/graphql/` (GraphiQL).

### Cache Issues

If changes aren't appearing:
1. Are you on the `.29next.store` domain? (Mapped domains cache for 5 min)
2. Try appending `?skip_cache` or a unique query string
3. For asset changes, hard-refresh the browser (Cmd+Shift+R)
4. Template changes pushed via ntk should bust the cache automatically — if not, wait ~30 seconds and retry
